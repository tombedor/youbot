# Modules necesary


## Configuration / state management

### AppConfig
global config for any app-wide configuration

### TaskRepository
depends on: ProjectRegistry (for commiting changes)

- CRUD operations on TODO.md

## Session handlers

### TmuxClient
- low level tmux operations
- opens, creates, lists tmux sessions


### SessionManager
depends on: TmuxClient for low level Tmux operations
depends on: CodingAgentSupervisor
depends on: Notifier

- uses tmux `monitor-silence` with per-coding agent configuration to detect activity or idleness of background coding agents
- if background session is completed or stuck, dispatches Notifier and CodingAgentSupervisor for post-session tasks
- if background session needs input, dispatches CodingAgentSupervisor
- knows which sessions are active or inactive

## Agents

### Coding Agent Supervisor
depends on: TaskRepository for CRUD ops on tasks

- trigger by a session going inactive, or a live coding session being exited

- provides input to coding agent for background tasks
- evaluates whether task is done for background agents
- on exit, reviews transcript, writes summary to captains log, updates task status



## Notifier
