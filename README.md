An AI personal assistant.

For the most part, these are experiments and utilities for the [MemGPT project](https://memgpt.ai)

Some experiments might require [my fork of that repo](https://github.com/tombedor/MemGPT)

### Things I am interested in implementing
- A personal assistant that manages calendars, reads emails, etc
- An RSS reader / general information subscriber that summarizes and learns from interesting info on the web
- An extension to MemGPT in which memories are consolidated, and a knowledge base is built
- An extension to MemGPT's memory capability, making the always-on context more dynamic.
- A cleaner way for GPT's to ingest error logs, improve their debugging capabilities
- Implementations with open source LLM's

### Projects I am interested in trying:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for running local models
- [Crew AI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) for multi-agent orchestration
- [Reflxion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) for task improvement / learning
- [TaskWeaver](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver) for task execution
- [This approach](https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/) for structured data with ChatGPT
- [Graph data / graph embeddings](https://github.com/shenweichen/GraphEmbedding)
- [Continue](https://continue.dev) for coding assistants
