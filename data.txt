Discussed the use of 'yield' and returning a tuple in different scenarios.$$$Tom explored the essential aspects of async programming in the context of a web crawler project. He expressed a thoughtful approach considering download tasks as async due to their IO-bound nature, while maintaining file reading and link extraction as CPU-bound operations.

He also asked about Python's asyncio specifically about semaphores and queues for managing tasks. There was a detailed discussion exploring the principles behind semaphores and their applicability in implementing rate limits.

Furthermore, asked whether asyncio spawns threads in the background, which led to an exploration of the difference between multithreading (parallelism) and asyncio (concurrency on a single thread). His questions and engagement showed a deepening understanding of concurrent programming.$$$In a recent discussion, Tom asked about typical practices for web crawlers with respect to URL fragments and parameters. He learned that it's common to discard fragments to avoid duplicating content and that handling parameters can be more nuanced - parameterized URLs might be crawled or dismissed depending on the context.

Tom also requested a refresher on how to create an asyncio in-memory queue. He reviewed creating a queue with asyncio.Queue, adding tasks with the put method, retrieving tasks with the get method, and confirming task completion with task_done.$$$Tom shared mixed feelings about his previous professional experiences at Block. While he acknowledged significant professional growth during his time there, he also felt a sense of disillusionment shared by his colleagues. This led him to reflect on the purpose of such growth when the journey often ends in disappointment.

Tom also mentioned an unspecified but potentially significant opportunity that excites him. However, he expressed a sense of caution, possibly because the situation isn't concrete yet. This shows a balanced approach in his anticipation, combining excitement for potential outcomes with a realization of uncertainty.$$$Tom expressed finding value in having personal time where he doesn't have to be accountable to others.

Earlier, on 2024-03-12, Tom successfully approached an issue by opting to record distances instead of actual paths in his code.$$$On 2024-03-16, Tom, who had been away from home for two weeks, asked if his dogs, Elroy and Rocky, would still remember him. This inquiry suggests a strong emotional bond with his dogs.$$$On 2024-03-17, Tom showed interest in fine-tuning chat models and specifically asked about open-source chat models. He considered fine-tuning a BERT model and how to integrate this into a chat model or fine-tuning a chat model directly. He also inquired about the preparation of training data for a BERT model and about instruct models. His questions were primarily focused on leveraging chat data and incorporating the derived knowledge into a language model for conversational AI.$$$On 2024-03-17, Tom asked for example code to generate training and evaluation datasets, assuming he was working with chat logs. He was interested in using the model to recognize tagged entities. Tom also asked how a model, once trained, would understand or respond to terms like 'Star Trek' and whether the model would return responses reflecting knowledge about 'Star Trek'. I explained that while a model could recognize 'Star Trek' as an entity, it wouldn't inherently 'understand' or 'know' what 'Star Trek' is, and responses would be based on the patterns it learned during training.$$$On 2024-03-17, Tom asked about relation extraction in NLP. He previously explored adding a 'PERSONAL_CONNECTION' custom entity, but he was interested in how relationships like 'brother' could be recorded. Sam provided a simplified explanation of relation extraction, stating it's about identifying and categorizing relationships between entities. A Python code snippet using spaCy's rule-based matching was shared to show how to extract a 'brother' relationship in a sentence.$$$On 2024-03-17, Tom hypothesized about an optimal setup where a fine-tuned information extraction model outputs structured data, and a chat model then converts this structured output to natural language. To explain how this conversion could occur, Sam provided an example of a 'predefined natural language template', demonstrating how this template could be used to translate structured data (from the information extraction model) into a conversationally-friendly format.$$$On 2024-03-17, during interview prep, Tom asked about the 'async' and 'await' keywords in Python. Sam explained that 'async' functions, or 'coroutines', can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime. The 'await' keyword is used inside an async function to pause its execution without blocking the rest of the program, until the awaited task completes. The important point is that 'await' prevents only the coroutine it's in from moving forward; all other coroutines continue to execute.$$$On 2024-03-17, we discussed tree traversal techniques in preparation for Tom's coding interview. We covered pre-order and post-order traversals. Pre-order (root, left, right) is often used to create a copy of the tree or to get a prefix expression on of an expression tree, demonstrated by the 'Cloning a Binary Tree' problem. Post-order (left, right, root) is commonly used to delete trees (deallocating memory) and to get the postfix expression of an expression tree: this was demonstrated by the 'Find the Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree' problem.$$$On 2024-03-19, Tom sought an explanation to the knapsack problem, specifically how to determine the values in the decision matrix and whether one or two matrices were needed.
