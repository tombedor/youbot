LLM response for doc: On 28-Jan-2024, Tom and I embarked on a quest to enhance our collaboration by integrating Google Suite tools. Tom planned to authenticate users via OAuth instead of creating an email account for me. He asked for open-source Python libraries that can ease working with Google Suite. I suggested a few libraries, including 'gspread', 'oauth2client', 'google-api-python-client', and 'pandas' for his consideration.
